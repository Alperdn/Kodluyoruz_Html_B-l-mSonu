<p>Avada Kedavra (Killing Curse) <br>

    Type: Curse <br>
    Pronunciation: ah-VAH-dah keh-DAV-rah <br>
    Description: Avada-Kedavra.gif <br>
    Causes instantaneous death. It is accompanied by a flash of green light and a rushing noise. There is no known Counter-curse that can protect the victim from dying, except for a loving sacrifice. It is one of the three Unforgivable Curses.[13]<br>
    Harry Potter was saved from this spell a number of times, both by his mother's sacrifice, because he was an accidental Horcrux, and because his wand and his enemy's were made of the same core.<br>
    
    Seen/Mentioned: Used by Tom Riddle to murder many of his victims without remorse.<br>
    Etymology: Avada Kedavra is based on the Aramaic אַבַדָא כְּדַברָא, avada kedavra, meaning "let the thing be destroyed".<br>
