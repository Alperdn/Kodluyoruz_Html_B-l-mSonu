    <p>We’re glad you asked… We’re building the official hub for fans of Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts. The new digital heart of the Wizarding World, if you will. It’s all very exciting. <br>
        Wizarding World Digital is a partnership between Warner Bros. and Pottermore, delivering official updates and products from the Wizarding World and its partners. <br>
        The website may contain images and clips from the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films that some parents may consider to be inappropriate for younger children. Parental discretion is advised. <br>
